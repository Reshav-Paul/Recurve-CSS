# Recurve-CSS

RecurveCSS aims to provide the responsive grid based layout framework of twitter bootstrap but in a desktop first development approach. Most of the class names are same as bootstrap but a reduction in the length of these names have been made wherever required. You can use all the bootstrap components while using RecurveCSS for the layout. This library does not provide html element restyling beyond some basic improvements. This leaves you to customize your website however you want without the imposition of any colour scheme or design sense from the library itself. Besides the layout utilities some classes are provided to cover the most used css rules so that you don't have to write them everytime.
